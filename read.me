enviornment requirement


* Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
    * It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. If you're not already using a virtual environment, you can create one:  `` python -m venv venv   ``
    * Activate the virtual environment:
    On macOS and Linux:
    ``source venv/bin/activate``
    * On Windows (using Command Prompt):
    ``venv\Scripts\activate ``
    On Windows (using PowerShell):
    ``.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 ``
* Install Flask:
    * With the virtual environment activated, use pip to install Flask:
    ``pip install Flask ``
* Check Flask Installation:
    * You can verify that Flask has been installed correctly by running:
    ``python -c "import flask; print(flask.__version__)" ``
    * You should see the version of Flask printed without any errors.
* Run Your Application:
    * Once Flask is installed, you should be able to run your Python application without encountering the "No module named flask" 
    error:``python app.py ``
* Replace app.py with the actual name of your Python application script if it's different.
By following these steps, you should have Flask installed in your Python environment, and your application should run without any ImportError related to Flask.
